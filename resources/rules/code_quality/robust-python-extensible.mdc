# Robust Python: Extensible Python

## Dependency injection
- Pass dependencies (objects/services) into functions or constructors; do not instantiate them inside the consumer.
- Use type hints to declare the interface of the injected dependency.
- **Verification**: Pass two different implementations of the same dependency to the same consumer and confirm both work.

## Composition
- Prefer "Has-A" over "Is-A". Build complex behavior by combining small, focused objects.
- Avoid god objects; delegate responsibilities to composed parts.
- **Verification**: Swap a composed component and show that behavior changes as intended.
